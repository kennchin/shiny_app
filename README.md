# Sample monitor report for clinical trials

This repository includes an example of a shiny app that monitors a typical clinical tria based on the user defined metrics.

Overview of the app:
  1. Choose the template desired of a protocol (user can build the template in a program)
  2. Upload the .CSV files (it can be modified to access a database-more in the future)
  3. Load the report
       - Overall tab: Overall graphs of treatment per year, progression, best response, and vital status.
       - Monitor tab: It contains important metrics for a simple clinical trial.
       - Death within 30 days tab: It contains metrics about the death of a patient in a trial.
       - Demographic tab: It contains metrics about the demographic of patients in a trial along with respective graphs (for easy viewing)
